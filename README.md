# What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers over time. It's basically when customers stop using your product or service and decide not to return. It's important for businesses to track and understand their churn rate, as it can have a significant impact on their bottom line.
# Telecom industry
Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

# Causes of churn
*	Poor customer service: Long wait times, unhelpful interactions, unresolved issues.
*	Product dissatisfaction: Product not meeting expectations, lack of features, bugs.
*	Competitor offerings: Better options available at competitive prices.
*	Pricing issues: Prices perceived as too high, hidden fees, unexpected charges.
*	Changes in customer needs: Needs evolve, your offering doesn't adapt.

# Customer retention
Keeping your customers happy while managing a large crowd can feel like juggling flaming bowling pins. Time and resources are limited, making it impossible to shower everyone with personalized attention. But what if you could predict who's about to jump ship?
Here's where customer churn prediction comes in. Just like a weather forecast, it uses data to tell you which customers are at high risk of leaving. This lets you focus your efforts on saving the "at-risk" ones, maximizing your impact and saving precious resources.Think of it like this: Instead of sending everyone a generic umbrella, you only give them to those caught in a downpour.

# Objectives
*	Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.
*	Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn
*	Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non-churn customers
